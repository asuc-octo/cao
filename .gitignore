# See https://help.github.com/articles/ignoring-files for more about ignoring
# files.
#
# If you find yourself ignoring temporary files generated by your text editor
# or operating system, you probably want to add a global ignore instead:
#   git config --global core.excludesfile '~/.gitignore_global'

# Ignore bundler config.
/.bundle

# Ignore bower_components 
/bower_components
/vendor/assets/bower_components

# Ignore all logfiles and tempfiles.
/log/*.log
/tmp

# Ignore RVM/Ruby version manager config files. These are only for auto-
# selecting the correct Ruby and gemset locally. It is a good idea to generate
# these files for yourself. If using RVM, do so by typing this on the command
# line, in the project root directory:
# rvm --ruby-version use some-ruby-version@some-gemset
.ruby-version
.ruby-gemset

# Ignore the .env file. It contains sensitive info!
.env

# Ignore all documentation files. They can be generated using YARD locally if
# desired: type 'yard' on the command line, in the project root directory.
/doc
/.yardoc

# Ignore all RubyMine specific files.
# MY NOTE: Feel free to remove this if you are not using RubyMine as your IDE.
/.idea

# Ignore all OS X specific .DS_Store files.
# MY NOTE: Ideally, you should ignore this globally if you are on OS X. However,
# It is easy enough to forget, so we include it here. Feel free to remove if you
# are not on OS X, or have ignored it globally.
**/*.DS_Store
